## Task
Basic blockchian program should be created

## Description
We creaded the project using linked list of linked list (graph). We have done it step by step. At the beginning
we encounter some difficulties but with more research (yeah google always helps) we completed it.

## Installation
This depends on your system. If you use Windows you have to install GCC compiler, and you are able to run make.
If you use Linux or MacOs no need installation

## Usage
1) run with `make` command
2) run `./my_blockchain`
3) you can use following command after running
    add node nid add a nid identifier to the blockchain node.
    rm node nid... remove nodes from the blockchain with a nid identifier. If nid is '*', then all nodes are impacted.
    add block bid nid... add a bid identifier block to nodes identified by nid. If nid is '*', then all nodes are impacted.
    rm block bid... remove the bid identified blocks from all nodes where these blocks are present.
    ls list all nodes by their identifiers. The option -l attaches the blocks bid's associated with each node.
    sync synchronize all of the nodes with each other. Upon issuing this command, all of the nodes are composed of the same blocks.
    quit save and leave the blockchain.
